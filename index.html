<h2>
Vision
</h2>

<p>

WoLLIC is a series of workshops which started in 1994 with the aim of
fostering interdisciplinary research in pure and applied logic. The
idea is to have a forum which is large enough in the number of
possible interactions between logic and the sciences related to
information and computation, and yet is small enough to allow for
concrete and useful interaction among participants.

<h2>
Venue
</h2>

<h4>Alexandru Ioan Cuza University</h4>

WoLLIC 2022 takes place at the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University in Iaşi,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania">Romania</a> (to be
confirmed). The <a href="uaic.ro">Alexandru Ioan Cuza University</a>
is the oldest higher education institution in Romania, <a
href="https://www.uaic.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/documentinfiintareuniviasi.jpg">founded
in 1860</a>. The university currently has over 24 000 students and
around 800 academic staff. The beautiful city of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ia%C8%99i">Iași</a> is known as
the cultural capital of Romania and it has a vibrant and rich
cultural, educational, social, and artistic life.

<h4>Travel</h4>

The easiest way to reach Iași is via its international airport,
situated close to the city. The airport services multiple direct
flights each week to various international destinations, including:
London, Vienna, Rome, Paris, Madrid, Brussels, Tel Aviv, Munich,
Cologne, Larnaca, Glasgow, Barcelona, Valencia, Bergamo (Milan),
Turin, Florence, Catania, Treviso (Venice).

Also, several direct flights are operated daily to and from Bucharest
Otopeni airport (flight time: less than 1h), the main air transport
hub in Romania.

Find more information on the <a
href="https://www.aeroport-iasi.ro/">Iași airport website</a>.

To reach Iași city center from the airport, the best way is by
taxi. The fare takes around 15 minutes and should cost around 25 RON
(about 5 euros). A taxi station is located just outside the airport
terminals (you will see a long line of taxis -- you must take the
first one). The price per kilometer of all taxi companies in Iasi is
around 2.5 Lei/kilometer during day time with a similar starting fee
(equivalent of about 0.5 Euro).

As a cheaper but significantly less convenient alternative, bus number
50 connects the airport to the city center. The bus stop is next to
the taxis. There is typically one bus every couple of hours, and the
depature/arrival schedule is usually synchronized with airplane
arrivals/departures. The price for a single trip is 2.5 RON. The
simplest way to get tickets is to use a contactless debit/credit card
(non-conctactless will not work) and buy them directly in the bus from
the automated vending machines.

<h4>Visa Information</h4>

Romania is part of the European Union. Citizens of a number of
countries require a visa to enter Romania. Detailed information
including the process to obtain a visa can be found on the <a
href="https://mae.ro/en/node/2040">site of the Romanian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs</a>. Typically, the visa that would be required for
attending a conference is a short-stay visa of type C/ZA. If you need
an invitation letter for obtaining a visa please contact us the
organizers as soon as possible.
